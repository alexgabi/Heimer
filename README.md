## Heimer

Heimer is a desktop application for creating mind maps and other suitable diagrams. It's written in Qt and targeted for Linux and Windows.

Here is a simple mind map of Heimer itself running on Ubuntu 20.04:

## Donations

It takes a lot of effort to develop and maintain Heimer, so if you find the application useful it would be very much appreciated to tip the project and help to keep the development active.

## Installation

See https://github.com/juzzlin/Heimer/releases for available pre-built packages.

### Linux: Snap

On Linux distributions that support universal Snap packages you can install Heimer like this:

`$ snap install heimer`

Run:

`$ heimer`

For more information see https://snapcraft.io/heimer and https://docs.snapcraft.io/core/install

Snap is the recommended way to install Heimer on Linux.

### Linux: Deb

There are Debian packages for Ubuntu/Debian. Use some graphical tool to install, or as an example on `Ubuntu 20.04`:

`$ sudo apt install ./heimer-2.5.0-ubuntu-20.04_amd64.deb`

Run:

`$ heimer`

### Linux: AppImage

`AppImage` is a "universal" package that can (in theory) be run on all Linux platforms:

Make the image executable e.g. like this:

`$ chmod 755 Heimer-2.4.0-x86_64.AppImage`

Run:

`$ ./Heimer-2.4.0-x86_64.AppImage`

### Windows

For Windows there's an installer and alternatively a ZIP-archive that just contains the Heimer executable.

## Setting the language

You can set the language manually with `--lang` option. For example, Finnish:

`$ heimer --lang fi`

Show all available options:

`$ heimer -h`

## Building the project

Currently the build depends on `Qt 5` only (`qt5-default`, `qttools5-dev-tools`, `qttools5-dev`, `libqt5svg5-dev` packages on Ubuntu). Support for `Qt 6` is preliminary and should work with `CMake`.

In the case of missing `qt5-default`, install these packages manually: `qtbase5-dev`, `qtchooser`, `qt5-qmake`, `qtbase5-dev-tools`.

Command to install all (at least most) needed dev packages on Ubuntu:

`$ sudo apt install build-essential cmake qtbase5-dev qtchooser qt5-qmake qtbase5-dev-tools qttools5-dev-tools qttools5-dev libqt5svg5-dev`

### Linux / Unix

The "official" build system for Linux is `CMake`.

Building for Linux in a nutshell:

`$ mkdir build && cd build`

`$ cmake ..`

`$ make -j4`

Run unit tests:

`$ ctest`

Install locally:

`$ sudo make install`

Debian package (`.deb`) can be created like this:

`$ cpack -G DEB`

See `Jenkinsfile` on how to build other packages in Docker.

### Windows

The NSIS installer for Windows is currently built in Docker with MXE (http://mxe.cc):

`$ ./scripts/build-windows-nsis`

This is so very cool! A Windowsless Windows build!

Anyway, as the project depends only on Qt SDK you can use your favourite Qt setup to build the project on Windows.
